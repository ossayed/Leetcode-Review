# Leetcode-Review

Simple script I made to randomly output coding interview problems I have done in the past so I can retain information better using
spaced reptitation. Influence to use spaced repitation for coding interview problems came from using Anki decks to better learn and
retain chinese characters and finding that to be really effective, so perhaps applying spaced reptitation in a differnt venue could
also be effective, possibly effective enough to quickly code this up anyway.

To use just run the python script in a folder containing problems.pkl, put in name of the new leetcode problem you have done 
for the day as well as the link, and be given a previously completed problem to review.
